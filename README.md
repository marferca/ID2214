# ID2214-Programming_for_Data_Science

The course covers the following topics:

- Syntax and semantics for programming languages that are particularly suited for data science, e.g. Python, Julia
- Routines for importing, combining, transforming and selecting data
- Algorithms for handling missing values, discretisation and dimensionality reduction
- Algorithms for supervised machine learning, e.g. naïve Bayes, decision trees, random forests
- Algorithms for unsupervised machine learning e.g. k-means clustering
- Libraries for data analysis
- Evaluation methods and performance metrics
- Visualising and analysing results
